    To win the game you have to click all the trash and put it into the garbage can.  To pick up a cigarette you press the space bar.
    Be careful because if you pick up an animal you will harm the environment. If you don't know what a space bar is, it is basically the button you use 
    to put in a break between words. It is located at the bottom center of your keyboard. To walk you use the left and right arrow keys
    which are situated at the bottom right side of the keyboard.
     
     The rest of the game is for you to discover and enjoy.
