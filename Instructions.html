    <p>
    To win the game you have to click all the trash and put it into the garbage can. You do this by left clicking the mouse and dragging
    it into the garbage can. If you don't know what a mouse is, it is basically a much better alternative to the keypad and normally is
    sold seperately from the computer. To run you use the left and right arrow keys which are situated at the bottum right side of the 
    keyboard. The rest of the game is for you to discover so enjoy.
